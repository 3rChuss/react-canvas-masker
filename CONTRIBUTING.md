## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/3rChuss/react-mask-editor.git
   cd react-mask-editor
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```
   > This project uses **npm** as the package manager.

---

## Development

### Main Library

- Source code is in `src/`.
- Entry point: `src/index.ts`.
- Main component: `src/components/MaskEditor.tsx`.
- Utility hooks: `src/hooks/useMaskEditor.ts`.
- Utilities: `src/utils.ts`.

### Example App

- Located in `example/`.
- Run locally to test changes in the library.

---

## Scripts

### Main Project Scripts (`package.json`)

- `npm run clean` — Remove `dist/` and build artifacts.
- `npm run compile` — Compile TypeScript to `dist/`.
- `npm run dist` — Build the library for distribution (Webpack).
- `npm run storybook` — Start Storybook for component development.

### Example App Scripts (`example/package.json`)

- `npm run dev` — Start the Vite dev server for the example app.
- `npm run build` — Build the example app for production.
- `npm run lint` — Lint the example app source code.
- `npm run preview` — Preview the production build locally.

---

## Linting & Formatting

- **ESLint**: Configured for both the main library and the example app. See `eslint.config.js` in each folder.
- **Prettier**: Formatting is enforced via `.prettierrc` (if present) and `.editorconfig`.
- **TypeScript**: Strictly typed via `tsconfig.json` (main) and `example/tsconfig.*.json`.

---

## Testing

> **Note:** There is currently no automated test suite. Manual testing is done via the example app and Storybook. Contributions to add automated tests are welcome!

---

## Documentation

- Main documentation is in `README.md`.
- Example usage and screenshots are in `docs/` and `example/`.
- Storybook provides interactive documentation for components.
